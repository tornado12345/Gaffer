Federated Store
============

This store is experimental, the API is unstable and may require breaking changes.

The `FederatedStore` is simply a Gaffer store which forwards operations to a
collection of sub-graphs and returns a single response as though it was a single graph.

Please see [FederatedStore Walkthrough](https://gchq.github.io/gaffer-doc/getting-started/developer-guide/federatedstore.html) for more details on how to set up and use this store.
