Sketches Library
============
This module contains various libraries for sketches.

In order to make use of the sketches libraries you will need to include this library as a dependency:
```
 <dependency>
  <groupId>uk.gov.gchq.gaffer</groupId>
  <artifactId>sketches-library</artifactId>
  <version>${gaffer.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

You will then need to register the SketchesJsonModules using the store or system
property: gaffer.serialiser.json.modules. This property takes a CSV of classes
so you can use multiple json modules.
```
gaffer.serialiser.json.modules=uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.sketches.serialisation.json.SketchesJsonModules
```
