Spark Library
============
This module contains various spark libraries for Gaffer.

In order to make use of the spark libraries you will need to include these libraries as a dependency:

```
 <dependency>
  <groupId>uk.gov.gchq.gaffer</groupId>
  <artifactId>spark-library</artifactId>
  <version>${gaffer.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

You will then need to register the spark operations and their handlers with your store.
Currently only spark operation handlers for the Accumulo Store have been written.
To use spark with accumulo you will need to include this dependency:
```
 <dependency>
  <groupId>uk.gov.gchq.gaffer</groupId>
  <artifactId>spark-accumulo-library</artifactId>
  <version>${gaffer.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Then to register the spark operations with the accumulo store you just need
to add the following to your store properties file.
```
gaffer.store.operation.declarations=sparkAccumuloOperationsDeclarations.json
```
