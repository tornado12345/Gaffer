Basic Demo
=============

## Deployment
Assuming you have Java 8, Maven and Git installed, you can build and run the latest version of the road traffic demo by doing the following:

```bash
# Clone the Gaffer repository, to reduce the amount you need to download this will only clone the master branch with a depth of 1 so there won't be any history.
git clone --depth 1 --branch master https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer.git
cd Gaffer

# Run the start script. This will download several maven dependencies such as tomcat.
# If you have a snapshot version and want to build all dependencies first then add -am as a script argument
./example/basic/scripts/start.sh
```

The rest api will be deployed to localhost:8080/rest.
